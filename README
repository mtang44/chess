CMPM 123 Assignment 5 Chess Fen String - Michael Tang 

For this assignment we need to be able to read a fen string and convert the chess board to the proper board state 
For this assignment I referenced the instructional yuja class video where the professor breaks down the 
implementation of the FENtoBoard code. 

How FENtoBoard works is it starts by reading off each character in the fen string. If the string is
a '/' then the code moves the current row down a line.
otherwise if the character is a number, that number corresponds to the number of 
open spaces until the next piece. We take that number and add it to the current column. 

If the string is not a number of '/' then it must be a piece so we then use a switch case testing for each possible piece. Knight, pawn, queen etc. 
Finally the game will create a bit object connected to the player and set that bit's position to the hitholder's position. We also call SetGameTag which is used to store which side the piece is on.

The code provided by the professor was very straightforward.
